# AgriAI
Agriculture has been the backbone of human existence. Since time is immortal. It has also seen much advancement over
the years. Agriculture sector of Indian economy is the mainstay of the rural Indian economy. Presently this sector
accounts approx. 14% in the GDP. Agriculture in India is the core sector for food
security, nutritional security, and sustainable development &
for poverty alleviation.Maintaining soil fertility, efficient soil fertility, most
importantly time of farmers to gain better results. Precision
agriculture technologies, awareness about the condition for
example can optimize fertilizer applications.With
technological advancement we gain better results as
technology enhances the conditions of agriculture sector by
monitoring and checking the status of the crops. It also helps
the farmers making them aware of the advantages of using
modern technology.Since most of the Indian population is based on agriculture, it is thus very
necessary to make proper use of technology in production
rather than using outdated technologies which hamper the
yield and growth. In most of the cases we see the farmers rely
on their instinct which in many cases can hamper their
productivity. With the introduction of our product this thing
will not going to happen any-more.With the use of this
product we try to ensure the economic well being of the
farmers to attain maximum growth in production level. Our
main target would be to remove the middle man between the
farmers and the market for whom the hike in price, inflation in
the market occurs. The focus will be on implementing
efficient farm management.Technological
advancement results in low cost of production and minimizes
the wastage of resources that leads to increase in output level.Our product is unique in every aspect possible and it is
the first of its kind. We are using AI along with Image
Processing for the data collection and manipulation. The
processed data can be sent to a database using wireless
communication. The device will have a user interface so that
the farmers, owners of the land can communicate with it. The
system will tell what to do after analysing the input data
which can be either fertility of soil or the quality of the crops
or any infectious disease. For this, it will surely increase the
productivity and even the system will analyse the soil
conditions its features and tell the farmers which crop would
be more profitable for him to grow based on data collected all
over India.
The key points of the following project would be:-
 Integrating IoT in Farms and deducing relations between Soil and Environmental Factors with Automated sprinkler system.
• Tracking Harvesting with hyperspectral Camera using drones
• Incorporating Farm data into analytics for Optimizing yields including yield estimation using computer Vision and Yield predictive analysis
• Geo Spatial Analysis of the farm using Satellite Imaging and Data Plotting
• Building Optimized Computer Vision Models to detect and classify plant diseases
• Deploying Model Analytics and Visualization on Web Application and Mobile Client for Real time Data Classification.
•Analysis of Project Impact and Product Viability and Market
